# AppleBoy - A C Gameboy Emulator
I began this project after awakening interesting in hardware emulation. I thought an old gaming system like the Nintendo Gameboy would be a good starter project, but it was nowhere as easy as I thought it would be.
This project has been incredibly useful, it has made me more profecient at programming in C and gave me a better understanding of early gaming hardware.

As of updating this README, I have added NO code of my own to this project, but I intend to expand on this project, seeing as the series that documented its development was dropped.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to LowLevelDevel/rockytriton for providing the guide which I followed for the early stages of development. I could not have done this without his help.
If you wish to also follow his guide, you can find it in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxiWMqQvhg_yk4qy2cSC3457wZJga_e5
